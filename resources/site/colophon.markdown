hannah.io is generated by [Static](https://github.com/nakkaya/static), a static site generator written in Clojure. I used [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the lovely [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/) for style and layout. The background is [Tree Bark](http://subtlepatterns.com/tree-bark/) from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/).  

The faults are mine.
